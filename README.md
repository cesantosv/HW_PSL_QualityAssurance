# HW_PSL_QualityAssurance

Here is our challenge

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-sort/problem

In this repo you can see our homework of quality assurance with TDD and BDD using JUNIT

We used TDD to write our Tests Cases (7). The 3 most important are for testing the sorting by CGPA, FNAME OR ID If it's necessary.

We did a solution too with a comparable in the class student.

We used BDD to describe each test case in the class StudentTest.

## Run Tests

```bash
$ mvn test
```


## Compile Application.


```bash
$ mvn package
```

##  Version.


```bash
 JUnit 4.12
```


Another way to run this app is by cloning the project as a JUnit Test in an Eclipse IDE.
It's necessary to import as a maven project and choosing the root that is the location of the directory of the project that you already cloned.

We got a coverage of 83,1 %, it can be done by executing the option Coverage As -> JUnit Test in Eclipse IDE.
